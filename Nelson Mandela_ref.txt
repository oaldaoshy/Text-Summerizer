Nelson Mandela` was born on July 18th, 1918 in the village of Mvezo in Umtata, then a part of South Africa's Cape Province.  Before becoming actively involved in the anti-apartheid struggle, Mandela survived many years of his life as a subject of colonialism.  As a child in Africa, Mandela was a victim of the European colonial project which involved 'civilizing' indigenous communities by silencing African ways of life in favour of a Euro-centric culture.  In 1994, he led the country to the end of apartheid and was elected the first black president of South Africa.  After he retired from public life, Mandela continued to embody the hopes and dreams of a free and equal world.  Today, Nelson Mandela, popularly known as `Madiba' in South Africa, is a household name all over the world.
