It is argued that women have their domestic duties to perform, and that, if they were educated, they would bury themselves in their books and have little time for attending to the management of their households.  Of course it is possible for women, as it is for men, to neglect necessary work in order to spare more time for reading sensational novels.  But women are no more liable to this temptation than men, and most women would be able to do their household work all the better for being able to refresh their minds in the intervals of leisure with a little reading.  For education involves knowledge of the means by which health may be preserved and improved, and enables a mother to consult such modern books as will tell her how to rear up her children into healthy men and women and skillfully nurse them and her husband when disease attacks her household. Also one of a mother's highest duties is the education of her children at the time when their mind is most amenable to instruction.
