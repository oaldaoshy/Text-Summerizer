A visit to a historical place is always an exciting experience.  I had one such experience during the last summer vacations, when I visited Delhi.  After some rest, we undertook a visit to Delhi.  On one hand there are Red Fort, Jama Masjid, Jantar Mantar, Qutub Minar, India Gate which narrate the glorious past of India; while Rashtrapati Bhawan, Lotus Temple, Parliament, to name a few, are the wonders of modern times. We visited the Red Fort first.  The Red Fort is also known as Lal Quila and is the landmark of Delhi.  It is built using red stones.  Another superb structure like Pearl Mosque on Moti Masjid is built near Rang Mahal. I enjoyed my trip to the Red Fort very much.
